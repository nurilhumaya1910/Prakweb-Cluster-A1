    <p> Trinity is Indonesia’s leading travel writer and blogger with 15 national best-selling books including The Naked Traveler series. Two of the books have been adapted into 2 movies, titled Trinity, The Nekad Traveler and Trinity Traveler.</p>

<p>In 2005, she started Indonesia’s first travel blog at naked-traveler.com, which by 2007 had attracted the notice of publishers. Her debut book The Naked Traveler was a compilation of thoughtful but hilarious short stories from her adventure around the world. The book inspired many Indonesians, especially young people to travel, something that was still quite rare at the time.</p>

<p>Trinity chose “naked” in the title because it means something that’s not shielded and glossed over. Unlike most travel writing, which tends to rhapsodize about the beauty and attractiveness of a place, Trinity’s blog and books cover both the positive and the negative. “Naked” is also a pun from Indonesian word “nekad” (reckless/bravery).</p>

<p>The Naked Traveler series now has eight titles; all are Indonesia’s best-selling travel books to date, including The Naked Traveler: 1 Year Round-the-World Trip (part #1 & part #2) and the last series The Naked Traveler 8. Trinity, along with Erastiany and illustrator Sheila Rooswitha, created Indonesia’s first graphic travelogue Duo Hippo Dinamis: Tersesat di Byzantium  (The Dynamic Hippos: Lost in Byzantium). She also contributed to the anthologies The Journeys, TraveLove, The Naked Traveler Anthology, and The Naked Traveler Anthology: Horror. Her book in English The Naked Traveler, Across the Indonesian Archipelago tells what travel is really like in her own country. Recently she and her travel buddy, Yasmin, published 69 Cara Traveling Gratis (69 Ways to Travel Free) targeting the Millennials.</p>

<p>Previously, she was an English-Indonesian literary translator, copy writer, Editor in Chief of Venture – an English travel magazine, Radio Personality of Indika FM, regular contributor of Yahoo! Travel, columnist of JalanJalan travel magazine, and TV host of The Naked Traveler on Food Travel channel. Trinity won an Indonesia Travel & Tourism Awards as Indonesia’s Leading Travel Writer in 2010 and was voted as one of 5 Most Important Persons in Indonesian Tourism by detikTravel Readers’ Choice in 2014.</p>

<p>With hundreds of thousands of followers, Trinity is one of Indonesia’s most influential persons in social media. She was acclaimed as one of 12 Most Influential Indonesian Women on Twitter by Swa magazine in 2010 and a nominee in RCTI Social Media Awards 2016.</p>

<p>Her life inspired many, became a sought-after speaker at a variety of events on blogging, tourism, and passion. She was a participating author at Indonesia’s biggest literary festivals; Ubud Writers & Readers Festival and Makassar International Writers Festival. Recently she was one of 70 top Indonesian authors participating in Frankfurt Book Fair 2015 to promote Indonesian literary in the world’s biggest book fair.</p>

<p>Trinity’s love of writing began when she was 6 years old; she consistently took a role as a journalist in school newspapers from primary school until she was in university. She has a Bachelor Degree in Communications from Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia, and was awarded an Asian Development Bank-Japan Scholarship to do her Master in Management at the Asian Institute of Management, Manila, Philippines.</p>

<p>She has traveled to almost all provinces of Indonesia as well as 93 countries around the world – and counting. She still thinks Indonesia is the best country she has ever visited.
